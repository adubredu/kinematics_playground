# kinematics playground

A hodge-podge of experimental Julia scripts to generate Forward Kinematics equations for arbitrary open-chain links and to solve the Inverse Kinematics using Nonlinear Constrained Optimization. There is no intent to clean up the scripts or organize them logically so use at your own peril ;)
